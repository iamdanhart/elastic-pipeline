This project represents a proof of concept using a Logstash pipeline to populate an ElasticSearch index on a regular schedule with data sourced from Postgres.

This project is PURELY for learning purposes on localhost; passwords are embedded in the clear in the docker-compose, and therefore nothing should be deployed to a cloud instance.
